      <h3>The Future of Preventative Healthcare</h3>
      <p>
        The <strong>AI-Driven Preventative Health Assistant</strong> is a conceptual web platform designed to bring together wearable devices,
        artificial intelligence, and secure, patient-controlled health data into a single, easy-to-use interface. This project is presented
        as a <strong>two-page website</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Overview Page</strong> â€“ Explains the vision, technology, and real-world need behind the innovation.</li>
        <li><strong>Interactive Product Concept Page</strong> â€“ Demonstrates how the assistantâ€™s dashboard might look and function through dynamic mockups,
          live charts, and simulated patient data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The concept focuses on <strong>early detection and intervention</strong> by continuously monitoring vital signs, applying machine learning to detect
        subtle health changes, and delivering personalized recommendations directly to the patient or their healthcare provider.

      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>
        Modern healthcare is often <strong>reactive</strong> rather than <strong>proactive</strong>. Chronic illnesses such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers
        are frequently diagnosed only after symptoms have developedâ€”when treatment is more complex and costly.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Late detection</strong>: Many health risks develop silently over months or years.</li>
        <li><strong>Fragmented systems</strong>: Wearables, medical records, and patient apps often exist in silos without seamless data sharing.</li>
        <li><strong>Limited patient empowerment</strong>: Individuals have little control over how their health data is collected, used, or shared.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h3>The Solution</h3>
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li><strong>Continuous Monitoring:</strong> Pulls real-time data from wearables (e.g., heart rate, sleep patterns, SpOâ‚‚, activity) and home medical devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Predictive Analytics:</strong> Machine learning models detect early warning signs (e.g., irregular heartbeat, sleep apnea risk, BP trends) before symptoms arise.</li>
        <li><strong>Personalized Recommendations:</strong> Targeted lifestyle tips, follow-up reminders, and health alerts tailored to the userâ€™s data profile.</li>
        <li><strong>Secure Data Ownership:</strong> Blockchain-style permissions so patients control who can access their data, for how long, and for what purpose.</li>
        <li><strong>Unified Interface:</strong> A single, intuitive dashboard with insights, historical trends, and AI alerts accessible from any device.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h3>How This Website Demonstrates the Concept</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Written Overview Page</strong> â€“ Clear, concise explanation of the problem, solution, and impact with references.</li>
        <li><strong>Interactive Product Concept Page</strong> â€“ User selector for multiple mock profiles, <strong>live charts</strong> (heart rate trend, sleep hours, sleep stages),
          <strong>AI alerts</strong>, <strong>recommendations</strong>, and quick <strong>KPIs</strong> (resting HR, average sleep, steps, AI risk score).</li>
        <li><strong>Static & Responsive</strong> â€“ Works on desktop and mobile, deployable on GitHub Pages, <em>no backend required</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Portfolio Polish</strong> â€“ Modern UI consistent with the rest of the site to showcase design and front-end skills.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Potential Impact</h3>
      <p>
        By shifting healthcare from <strong>reactive treatment</strong> to <strong>proactive prevention</strong>, this system can reduce hospital admissions, lower overall costs
        through earlier intervention, and improve patient quality of life. It also increases patient trust and engagement by giving them
        transparent control of their health data.
